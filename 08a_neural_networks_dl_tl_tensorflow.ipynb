    "- **Neural networks**, also known as artificial neural networks (ANNs) or simulated neural networks (SNNs), are a subset of machine learning and are at the heart of deep learning algorithms. Their name and structure are inspired by the human brain, mimicking the way that biological neurons signal to one another.\n",
    "- **Deep learning** is a subset of machine learning, which is essentially a neural network with three or more layers. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain—albeit far from matching its ability—allowing it to “learn” from large amounts of data. While a neural network with a single layer can still make approximate predictions, additional hidden layers can help to optimize and refine for accuracy. \n",

    "    - Classification (image, text/e-mail-spam), \n",

    "    - Object detection (similar to image-class., identify and locate an object in an image)\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Transfer learning** is a technique in machine learning in which knowledge learned from a task is re-used in order to boost performance on a related task. For example, for image classification, knowledge gained while learning to recognize cars could be applied when trying to recognize trucks. \n",
    "- **Tensorflow**  is a free and open-source software library (deep learning, numerical computing) for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks\n",
